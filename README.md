# PyGaia

Python toolkit for Gaia science performance simulation and astrometric catalogue data manipulation.

## Description

PyGaia provides python modules for the simulation of Gaia data and their uncertainties, as well modules for the
manipulation of the Gaia catalogue data. In particular transformations between astrometric observables and phase space
variables are provided as well as transformations between sky coordinate systems. Only (very) basic functionality is
provided. Full blown simulations of Gaia data in all their gory detail requires the Java tools developed by the Gaia
Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) in particular its Coordination Unit 2 (CU2).

This toolkit is basically an implementation of the performance models for Gaia which are publicly available at:
[http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/science-performance](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/science-performance). In
addition much of the material in chapter 4 of the book [Astrometry for Astrophysics: Methods, Models, and
 Applications (2012, van Altena et al.)](http://www.cambridge.org/9780521519205) is implemented.

* The code in this package is __not intended for accurate astrometry applications__, such as predicting in detail
 astrometric paths of stars on the sky. 
* Epoch transformation _is_ provided, including the transformation of the astrometric covariance matrix to different
 epochs.
 
## Astropy astrometry modules versus pygaia.astrometry

It is recommended to use the [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) facilities for handling astrometric data, including transformations from (Cartesian) phase space coordinates to astrometric observables and vice versa. See the [`astropy.coordinates`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html) package. Compared to the [`pygaia.astrometry`](./src/pygaia/astrometry) package this gives you more functionality, the use of units, and much better maintained code.
 
The only functionality not (yet) provided in Astropy is the propagation of the covariance matrix of the astrometric observables to to a different epoch. This is implemented in the class [`pygaia.astrometry.coordinates.EpochPropagation`](./src/pygaia/astrometry/coordinates.py). Epoch propagation as such is implemented in Astropy as the [`apply_space_motion()`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/apply_space_motion.html) function of the [`SkyCoord`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.html#astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord) class.
