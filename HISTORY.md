## 3.2.2 (Dec 2024)

* Fixed error in DR5 estimatd end of data collection time.

## 3.2.1 (Dec 2024)

* Version change to fix automated PyPI publication.

## 3.2 (Dec 2024)

* Notebooks with examples integrated into documentation.

## 3.1 (Dec 2024)

* Added the Gaia data release time spans to the utils module.
* [Error in epoch propagation code fixed](https://github.com/agabrown/PyGaia/pull/14)
* Unit tests updated to work with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html)

## 3.0 (September 2022)

* Renamed master branch to main.
* Added new performance predictions for photometry and radial velocities (appeared on Gaia science performance pages after
  Gaia DR3).
* Changed repository layout.
* Updated to using pyproject.toml configuration and using pip to install from source.
* Cleaned up documentation and published on readthedocs.io.
* Changed license.

## 2.2 (January 2021)

* Fixed the typo noted in https://github.com/agabrown/PyGaia/pull/4

## 2.1 (December 2020)

* Minor fixes to code, documentation link in EpochPropagation class updated.

## 2.0 (December 2020)

* This version is for the post-Gaia EDR3 performance predictions which are extrapolated from the actual Gaia (E)DR3
 performances. See [https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/science-performance](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/science-performance)
* __MANY BREAKING CHANGES!__ For the pre-Gaia EDR3 version of the code see [https://github.com/agabrown/pygaia-v1
](https://github.com/agabrown/pygaia-v1)
* The performance predictions for astrometry now depend only on G and can only be generated for Gaia (E)DR3/DR4/DR5
. Variations as a function of sky position and colour are not included.
* The code was cleaned up, making it (more) conformant with the Python standards. This again causes many breaking
 changes due to renaming of modules and functions.

## 1.32 (October 2019)

* Mission length scaling in photometric and radial velocity uncertainties.

## 1.31 (September 2019)

* Allow for list of spectral types as input to vradErrorSkyAvg.

## 1.30 (March 2019)

* Switched from Basemap to Cartopy in sky.py.
* Epoch propagation added, including the propagation of the covariance matrix.
* Covariance matrix construction from Gaia catalogue columns, including "radial proper motion" term.
* Changed convention for longitude numerical values. They are now between 0 and 2PI instead of -PI and
  +PI. __THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE.__

## 1.22 (February 2019)

* Test cases slightly updated

## 1.21 (April 2018)

* Added constant AU expressed in mas*km*yr/s
* Fixed large memoery consumption in the _getJacobian method in the coordinate transformation code.
  Thanks to [jchelly](https://github.com/jchelly) for pointing out this problem.

## 1.2 (December 2016)

* Add method to CoordinateTransformation for the transformation of the full (5x5) covariance matrix of
  the astrometric parameters.
* Add keyword to astrometric errors prediction functions that allows to specify an extended mission
  lifetime.

## 1.1 (September 2016)

* Bug fix in coordinate transformation code.
* Updated photometry and radial velocity error predictions.
* End-of-mission photometry errors, including calibration floor, introduced for the broad band fluxes.
* Photometry errors now include 20% margin for CCD-transit and end-of-mission predictions.
* Example plot of photometry errors fixed.

## 1.0 (November 2015)

* Added numerical constants.
* Improved setup.py, made code compatible with Python3

## 0.9 (September 2015)

* Photometric performance predictions updated to post-launch estimates.

## 0.83 (July 2015)

* Minor error in documentation of astrometryToPhaseSpace() method corrected.

## 0.82 (July 2015)

* Error corrected in transformSkyCoordinateErrors() method. Thanks to Teresa Antoja and Taniya Parikh!

## 0.81 (June 2015)

* Forgot to update changelog for version 0.8

## 0.8 (June 2015)

* Radial velocity performance predictions updated to post-launch estimates.

  errors (corresponding to the sky regions with best/worst astrometric errors).
* Proper motion error plot.
* Parallax horizon plot.

## 0.4 (April 2013)

* Added transformation of proper motions and of position and proper motion errors.

## 0.31 (February 2013)
